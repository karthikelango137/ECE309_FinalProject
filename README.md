DESIGN:
The code is seperated into two main filed: uno.h and main.cpp.
The uno.h header file contains all of the classes and functions used to play uno from the main function.
The main.cpp function takes care of playing the game utilizing the classes and functions in the header file. The main function takes care of initializing all players and running the turns of the game.

HOW TO COMPILE:
Once you've got your compiler and source program ready, it is very easy to compile and run a C++ program. Assuming that you've installed GCC compiler, and you have a source.cpp file that you want to compile, follow the following instructions to compile and run it.

Step 1 − Open a new terminal window or cmd if you are on windows.

Step 2 − Change the directory to the directory in which you have your source.cpp file. For example, if it is in C:/Users/Dell/Documents, enter your command line −

$ cd 'C:/Users/Dell/Documents'

Step 3 − Now enter the following command to compile the source file using g++.

$ g++ -o <name-you-want-to-give> source.cpp
  
In place of <name-you-want-to-give> replace it by any name like myprogram, etc.

Step 4 − Run it! Now you can run the program using −

$ ./myprogram
